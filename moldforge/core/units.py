"""Scene units: convert MoldForge's millimetre size fields to Blender units.

Every size field in the panel is a length in **millimetres**. The geometry, however, is
built in Blender units, so the sizes have to be converted with the scene's actual unit
scale. Doing that (instead of assuming 1 Blender unit = 1 mm) is what makes the add-on
correct in an Imperial scene, or a metric scene whose unit isn't millimetres - not only
the "1 unit = 1 mm" convention.

``mm_per_unit`` is the single source of truth:

* No unit system (``system == 'NONE'``): the long-standing mold-maker convention, 1
  Blender unit = 1 mm.
* Metric or Imperial: a Blender unit is ``scale_length`` metres, i.e.
  ``scale_length * 1000`` mm. (Length is always metres internally; Imperial only changes
  how it's displayed, so the same formula holds.)

    Most mold makers model with the "1 unit = 1 mm" convention, and Blender's untouched
    default scene is Metric / Unit Scale 1.0 / Meters - so that exact default is honoured
    as 1 unit = 1 mm (changing it would silently shrink everyone's molds 1000x). But once
    the scene is actually configured for real units - Imperial, a changed Unit Scale, or a
    specific metric Length unit (mm, cm, ...) - we take it at face value: a Blender unit is
    ``scale_length`` metres, i.e. ``scale_length * 1000`` mm (length is metres internally,
    so this holds for Imperial too). That's the bug fix: Imperial and non-mm metric scenes
    no longer pretend 1 unit = 1 mm.
