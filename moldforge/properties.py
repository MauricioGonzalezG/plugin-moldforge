"""User-facing parameters for MoldForge, stored on the Scene.

All size fields are in MILLIMETRES, whatever the scene's unit system (Metric, Imperial,
or none). The build converts mm to Blender units with the scene's unit scale
(``core.units.mm_per_unit``), so a 3 mm wall is 3 mm whether the scene is set to
millimetres, inches, or the bare "1 unit = 1 mm" convention. Sensible defaults suit
print-scale models (~20-200 mm); the sprue/vents are auto-capped so they can't blow out
a small mold.
