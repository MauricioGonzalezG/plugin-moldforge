# MoldForge

A Blender add-on that turns a 3D model into a **printable mold system** — a 2‑to‑4
piece mold with an auto‑oriented, self‑registering split, sprue + air vents, a
mounting base and silicone/cast/plastic volume **and weight** estimates, or a
one‑part open tray for flat & relief objects. Exports STL.

Three output types (**Mold Type** in the panel):

- **Silicone Pour Box** (default) — prints a thin-walled **jacket** that covers
  your master with a gap; you nest the master inside and pour liquid silicone
  into the gap — the silicone is the mold. Controls: **Silicone Gap** and
  **Printed Shell Wall**. An `MF_Skin` object always shows exactly the silicone
  you'll pour. Tick **Glove Skin Keys** for the glove / mother-mold workflow
  (set a thin gap, e.g. 3 mm): registration **bumps on the skin** seat into
  matching **pockets in the jacket** so the thin skin can't shift or slump.
- **Direct Printed Mold** — the printed pieces *are* the mold; cast
  resin/wax/plaster straight in. One control: **Wall Thickness**, plus a
  **Shape**: *Hugging* (pieces follow the model — least material) or *Block*
  (rectangular — easiest to clamp and stand).
- **Tray / Open Pour** — a one‑part open **pan** for FLAT or relief objects
  (text, logos, coins, medallions). The object is laid flat with its detailed
  face up and the top left open: **Embed** it into the floor and pour silicone
  over it for a flexible stamp/mold, or print a **Frame** to drop a real object
  in and pour around it. Pick a **Rectangular** or material‑saving **Hug
  (rounded)** outline. No split, wings or funnel.

Requires **Blender 5.1+** (`blender_version_min = 5.1.0`); built and tested against Blender 5.1.

## Install

1. In Blender: **Edit ▸ Preferences ▸ Get Extensions ▸ ⌄ ▸ Install from Disk…**
   (or **Add-ons ▸ Install from Disk…**) and pick the MoldForge zip.
2. Make sure **MoldForge** is enabled.
3. Open the 3D viewport sidebar (press **N**) → **MoldForge** tab.

The tab holds three panels, in the order the work happens:

- **MoldForge** - the model you selected (name and size in mm), the few
  choices that change from toy to toy (mold type, bottom, the sizes, the split,
  what to add), and **Generate Mold**.
- **Result** - appears after a build: what was made, the silicone and cast
  figures, **Exploded Preview** and **Export STL**.
- **Advanced** - closed by default; every other setting grouped by the part of
  the mold it shapes (Shell & Base, Parting, Clamp Wings, Funnel & Vents,
  Printer Fit, Mesh Prep, Materials & Export). Each group shows its current
  setting at the right of its header, so a closed group still tells you what it
  holds.

## Use

1. Select the mesh you want to mold (make it the active object).
2. Set your parameters in the panel.
3. Click **Generate Mold**.

The mold pieces (`MF_Mold_A`, `MF_Mold_B`, …) and the printable positive
(`MF_Positive`) land **on the model's location** in a `MoldForge` collection;
your original model is hidden (the positive takes its place on screen - unhide
the original from the outliner whenever you want it back).
Export with **Export Mold Parts**, or tick **Export after generate**. A heavy
build runs with a wait cursor and a progress note so it never looks frozen.

## Sizes are in millimetres

Every size field is in **millimetres** (e.g. a 3 mm silicone wall, a 2 mm printed
shell) and the build converts mm to Blender units using your **scene's unit scale**
— so it's correct in an Imperial scene, or a metric scene whose unit isn't
millimetres, not only the "1 unit = 1 mm" convention. Specifically:

- **No unit system** (Scene ▸ Units ▸ None) — the classic mold‑maker convention,
  **1 Blender unit = 1 mm**.
- **Blender's untouched default** (Metric · Unit Scale 1.0 · Meters) is also taken
  as 1 unit = 1 mm, so existing files aren't disturbed.
- **Imperial, or metric once you configure it** (a Unit Scale ≠ 1, or a specific
  Length unit like mm/cm) — a Blender unit is taken at face value (`scale_length`
  metres), so a 3 mm wall is genuinely 3 mm. The panel shows the basis it's using
  (e.g. *1 unit = 25.4 mm*).

The defaults suit print‑scale models (~20–200 mm); the sprue/vents are auto‑capped
so they can't blow out a small mold — and the **Oversized Throat / Oversized Mouth**
toggles switch the funnel to **fully manual** (exactly the typed sizes, no cap at
all) when the auto fit isn't what you want.

## Parameters

| Group | Option | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mold | **Mold Type** | `Silicone Pour Box` (print a jacket, pour silicone), `Direct Printed Mold` (the print is the mold), or `Tray / Open Pour` (one‑part open pan for flat objects) |
| Mold | **Shape** | *(Direct mold)* `Hugging` (least material) or `Block` (easiest to clamp) |
| Tray | **Tray Mode** | *(Tray)* `Embed` (fuse the object in, pour silicone over it for a stamp), `Frame` (print the open box, drop a real object in), or `Stamp from SVG / Text` (below) |
| Tray | **Stamp from SVG / Text** | Make a real silicone INK STAMP: select a **Text/Curve object** or set an **SVG File** (filled paths), and the design is scaled to **Stamp Width** and **engraved Relief-Depth deep into the pan floor** — the printed mold is the negative. Pour silicone **Slab** deep, cure, peel: the slab carries the design raised and mirrored, so imprints read correctly; glue it to an acrylic block. **Mirror Design** flips it for face-reading stamps; the floor auto-thickens so the engraving can't pierce it |
| Tray | **Capture Face** + **Outline** | *(Tray)* which face points up (`Auto`/Z/X/Y) and a `Rectangular` or material‑saving `Hug (rounded)` pan outline |
| Tray | **Pan Wall / Pan Floor / Border / Pour Depth** | *(Tray)* printed wall & floor thickness, the silicone border around the object, and how much silicone stands above it |
| Sprue/Vents | **Vent Placement** + markers | `Auto (high points)` as before, or `Manual (markers)`: snap the 3D cursor onto the model (Shift+Right‑Click), press **Add Vent Marker**, and Generate drills ONE vent per marker — move/duplicate/delete the little sphere empties freely (they live in a "MoldForge Markers" collection and survive regeneration). The marker's full 3D position counts, so a mid‑height side pocket can be vented |
| Sprue/Vents | **Add Pour Marker** | Each cone marker adds an EXTRA pour spout at its X/Y (dropped onto the surface); the first spout keeps the **Placement** setting. Markers replace the automatic extra Pour Points while they exist |
| Mold | **Silicone / Wall Thickness** | Silicone thickness (pour gap / glove skin, or the direct mold's wall), in mm |
| Mold | **Printed Shell Wall** | *(Pour Box)* printed jacket wall |
| Mold | **Glove Skin Keys** | *(Pour Box)* glove/mother-mold workflow: bumps on the silicone skin seat into pockets in the jacket |
| Mold | **Bottom** | `Flat (closed)` (+ optional **Mounting Flange** with bolt holes) · `Open Bottom` (+ optional **Detachable Key Plate**: a pocket registers the model; a ring tongue on the shell drops into a groove around the plate's chin collar) · `Follow Model` · `Locking Base` |
| Mold | **Locking Base** *(Pour Box)* | A sawtooth plinth is united into the high‑poly positive; the shells get a matching socket that hugs it with **Lock Tolerance** (≈0.2 mm) so they lock on and can't slip, and the bottom prints open. Controls: **Base Height / Base Margin / Sawtooth Teeth / Tooth Depth / Lock Tolerance**. Untick **Unite Base with Model** to keep the base as a separate `MF_Mold_Base` part (exported with the shells) and leave your model untouched. Pre‑flatten the model's base so uniting the plinth loses no detail. Clamp wings (if on) hug the model only |
| Mold | **Suction Cup Former** *(Open Bottom / Locking Base)* | Also prints `MF_Mold_Cup`: a smooth **high‑poly** dome (**Cup Diameter** × **Cup Depth**, diameter 0 = auto ≈70% of the opening) on a plate with four diagonal legs that seat over the open bottom, legs that **fasten** (the pour floats the former - buoyancy): **Pin-Lock** (default, resin-safe - slide ~2 mm pins through the hook channels into shell grooves, zero flex), **Snap-Lock** (printed beads click in - flexible filaments), or **Band Cleats** (rubber bands, no shell cuts). Hollow underside saves filament. The opening and bottom height are measured off the mold itself, so a Locking Base's lower, wider sawtooth socket fits automatically. Cast with the mold inverted: fill, press the former in, and the material cures around the dome — the cast's base comes out as a **suction‑cup bell**. Pop the former out after cure |
| Split | **Mold Pieces** | 2–4. Two = a normal split; 3–4 splits into radial wedges around the vertical axis so undercuts on every side can release (each wedge pulls straight out) |
| Split | **Horizontal Split** + **Seam Height** | Also split the shell horizontally (XL molds print shorter pieces). The seam gets a profile‑hugging bolted flange ring — size the vertical holes for threaded inserts via **Bolt Diameter** (inserts in the lower lip, screws from the top) |
| Split | **Printer Fit** + **Printer** / **Max Print Height** / **Support Height** | Tick **Printer Fit**, then pick your printer (Anycubic Photon M7 / M7 Pro / M7 Max, M5s, M3, Mono X; Elegoo Mars, Saturn, Jupiter; Phrozen Sonic Mini, Mighty, Mega; Creality Halot; UniFormation GKtwo / GK3; Formlabs Form 4; Peopoly Phenom Forge; Ender‑3, Prusa, Bambu …) or type the height (0 = off). Any shell taller than the limit is cut into equal **stacked levels** — `MF_Mold_A_S1` (bottom) upward — with the bolted mating ring at **every** seam, so each piece fits the plate and the stack bolts back rigid. **Support Height** (default 5 mm) is reserved out of the limit so every level fits **with** its supports/raft. A too‑tall **positive** is cut as well — into glue‑up sections (`MF_Positive_S1` …) that self‑align: **pegs printed on each section's face** (Bolt Diameter, tapered tips) seat into clearance sockets in the next — stack, glue, done, no loose hardware. Nothing touches the cast surface, and seams stay above a Locking Base plinth; untick **Cut Positive Too** to keep it whole. Respects a manual Horizontal Split seam; warns if a piece still exceeds the limit (tall funnel, messy mesh) |
| Split | **Split Axis** | `Auto` picks the axis the model **releases best** along (fewest undercuts), falling back to the wider footprint when equal · or force `X` / `Y` |
| Split | **Parting Offset** | Slide the parting plane off‑centre along the split axis (auto‑clamped so neither half vanishes) |
| Split | **Contoured Parting** | Parting surface follows the model's mid‑profile and self‑registers (falls back to a flat plane) |
| Split | **Alignment Keys** + **Registration** | 0–4 keys on a flat parting: `Cone Keys` (pins into sockets) or `Interlocking Teeth` (a castellated row). For 3+ pieces this becomes **Seam Pins** between wedges |
| Output | **Exploded Preview** | One button under Generate slides every generated part apart to show how the kit assembles; press again to snap back exactly. Display only — Export reassembles first automatically |
| Mold | **Vac‑U‑Lock Plug** | *(Pour Box + Locking Base)* prints **`MF_Mold_Plug`** from the bundled **combined Vac‑U‑Lock + suction‑bell former** (`VUL-PLUG.stl`, **always at its original 91.8 mm size — no scaling, nothing to type**) standing on its own socket cross where the toy is thickest (it slides along the cross to the spot where a vertical column stays inside the toy for its full height, the base centre on a symmetric toy) — the sawtooth lips clamp into the shells' grooves. Cast inverted (fill the base, click it in — the bell traps an air cushion that keeps silicone out); demold and the toy's base carries the attachment channel **inside a working suction cup**. A mold too small for the real plug, or a toy with no spot that keeps the column inside, skips it with a note saying why |
| Mold | **Dual Density (2‑pour)** + **Soft Wall** | *(Pour Box + Locking Base)* firm‑core / soft‑shell kit: **`Core_Master`** = the model **eroded inward by Soft Wall (mm)** — a true offset, so the soft layer is the same thickness on the inside of a bend, the outside, the top and the flanks — riding a bare **+ socket cross carved from the same sawtooth plinth as the positive** — the lips ARE the teeth. Select it and Generate again for its own core mold (that run keeps your main mold as `Kept_*`, Bottom: Flat), cast it in FIRM silicone, then pour **INVERTED**: fill the open base with SOFT and **click the core in — the lips clamp into the grooves and excess burps out the open quadrants**; the layers bond as they cure. Its ridges are rounded to a third of the wall (1 to 3 mm), so no scale edge or vein becomes a sharp blade on the core. Features thinner than twice the wall simply get no core |
| Clamp | **Clamp Wings** + **Wing Width / Wing Thickness** | Flanges follow the actual shell contour at the seam, including the base and funnel. Width is the outward distance in the seam plane. Thickness is **per printed wing**: two mating wings together measure twice this value. Both settings are in millimetres and independent of the shell wall. |
| Clamp | **Wing Alignment** + **Key Size / Height / Spacing** | `None` · `Cone` · `Half Sphere` · `Half Cone` alignment keys on the wing mating faces: a raised key on one half seats into a matching socket in the other (grown by **Fit Clearance**), so the bolted halves can't shear. **Key Size** sets their diameter; **Key Height** how far they stand out (0 = auto, capped by the wing lip — taller punches the socket through the wing as a hole, which still aligns; Half Sphere caps at a hemisphere); **Key Spacing** spreads them along the seam at that pitch (default every 40 mm), dodging the bolt holes |
| Clamp | **Bolt Diameter** + **Auto Bolts** / **Bolts / Side** | Size of the clamp/flange bolt holes. Off by default (no holes: clamp with clips or bands). Tick **Auto Bolts** to place holes by flange height, or set an exact count per side/seam |
| Sprue | **Sprue** + **Throat Radius** + **Funnel Height** + **Mouth Flare** | A real raised pour **funnel** that opens into the cavity. **Throat Radius** is the narrow bottom (the hole into the mold); the mouth is throat × **Mouth Flare** (1.0 = straight tube, up to 4× = wide catch funnel); **Funnel Height** is how far it stands proud. Sizes auto‑fit the mold; tick **Oversized Throat / Oversized Mouth** for **fully manual** funnels (exactly the typed sizes, no cap — you own the result). The panel shows the exact throat Ø / mouth Ø being built |
| Sprue | **Pour Points** + **Center Sprue** | 1–4 funnels (more helps fill tall figures); centre them on the seam instead of the model's high point |
| Sprue | **Air Vents** + **Vent Radius** | 0–8 thin channels from the cavity's high points to the outside |
| Prep | **Heal / Decimate / Safe Remesh** | Clean up messy, heavy, or non‑manifold meshes |
| Material | **Silicone / Cast / Print density** | g/ml, used for the weight estimate (RTV silicone ≈ 1.1–1.2, resin ≈ 1.1, PLA ≈ 1.24) |

The panel reports the **silicone** (the pour amount, or the thin skin for a glove
mold), the **printed plastic**, and the **cast material** volume — in millilitres
**and grams** (using the densities above; assuming 1 unit = 1 mm).

## How it works

1. **Prep** — duplicate the model, optionally heal/decimate, and center it. A
   non‑manifold or very heavy mesh is voxel‑remeshed into a clean watertight solid.
2. **Shell**
   - *Pour Box*: `dilate(model, gap + shell) − dilate(model, gap)` (two `Solidify`
     passes + a boolean) gives a hollow jacket whose cavity is the model plus a
     uniform silicone gap; the `inner − model` solid is kept as the `MF_Skin`
     preview. With **Glove Skin Keys**, registration bumps are raised on the
     silicone (matching pockets end up in the jacket).
   - *Direct mold, Hugging*: one `Solidify` wraps the model in a uniform shell
     whose enclosed void is the casting cavity.
   - *Direct mold, Block*: a bounding box minus the model.
   - *Tray*: an open box around the object's footprint (rectangular, or a rounded
     hug of the outline); the object is laid flat, unioned into the floor (Embed)
     or left out (Frame), and the top is left open — no split, wings or funnel.
3. **Sprue & vents** — the solid funnel spout(s) are unioned on first (so wings can
   run up them), then bored through into the cavity *after* the wings, so the bore
   is always clear. Vents are cut from the cavity's high points, kept clear of the
   funnel mouths.
4. **Bottom** — `Flat` cuts a Z‑plane keeping a closed floor (the **Mounting
   Flange** adds a bolted skirt); `Open` cuts at the master's base so the cavity
   is open — its **Detachable Key Plate** instead emits a separate `MF_Mold_Base`
   whose pocket registers the model (and seals the pour) while a ring tongue on
   every shell piece's rim drops into a groove around the plate's chin collar; `Follow` leaves the bottom
   shaped to the model; `Locking Base` (pour box) builds a sawtooth **plinth** from
   the model's footprint, unites it into the high‑poly positive, and gives the
   shells a matching **tolerance socket** (smooth outside, toothed inside, sealed
   rim) with an open bottom so the master locks onto the base and can't slip.
5. **Split**
   - *2 pieces*: pick the pull axis (Auto = least undercut), then either a
     ray‑cast **contoured** mid‑profile parting (self‑registering) or a flat plane
     with cone keys / interlocking teeth, plus optional clamp wings.
   - *3–4 pieces*: intersect the mold with **radial pie‑slice prisms** to get
     wedges that each pull straight out, with a best‑effort vertical seam pin
     (ridge + groove) registering neighbours.
6. **Undercut check** — rays along the pull axis flag trapped pockets; you get a
   warning (with the % and axis) if the model may not release cleanly.
7. **Volume & weight** — `bmesh.calc_volume` on the silicone, the printed parts,
   and the model, scaled by your material densities.
8. **Export** — a small binary‑STL writer (works in any context, incl. headless).

## Test

```bash
blender --background --python moldforge/tests/test_headless.py
```

Builds molds across every mold type, piece count, base, and split mode; checks the
parts are watertight single solids with sane proportions at 2/20/200‑unit scales;
verifies the glove skin uses far less silicone than a thick pour and that radial
wedges tile the same mold; exercises auto‑orientation and the undercut metric; and
round‑trips STL export. Exits non‑zero on failure.

## Robustness

MoldForge validates its result (finite, watertight, single connected solid) and
never writes a broken STL. So:

- **Detailed / thin‑feature models** (fine surface texture, fins) make the offset
  shell shatter. MoldForge detects this and **auto‑remeshes once and retries** —
  Generate just works, with a warning that fine detail was smoothed.
- **Messy / heavy meshes**: a non‑manifold mesh makes the fast boolean solver bail,
  and a million‑poly mesh is painfully slow — so MoldForge voxel‑remeshes the model
  into a clean, light, watertight solid first. A 1M‑poly non‑manifold scan molds in
  ~30 s instead of failing.
- **Deep undercuts**: `Auto` already orients the split to release best; if a half
  still won't separate, MoldForge retries the other axis (and a coarse remesh)
  before giving up, and as a last resort trims a *minor* severed fragment to keep
  each piece one solid. For undercuts on every side, raise **Mold Pieces** to 3–4
  for a radial split. If it genuinely can't make a clean mold, the error reports how
  the piece broke up (e.g. "3 pieces: 88%, 7%, 5%") and suggests what to change.
- **Deeply concave models** (a hook, horseshoe, C‑shape) shed a few tiny slivers
  along the concavity; MoldForge strips those few‑face artifacts so the parts come
  out as clean single solids.
- **Clamp wings and seam pins** are best‑effort: each is welded only where it
  actually overlaps the body and rolled back if it would ever leave a piece broken,
  so registration features can never wreck an otherwise‑good mold.
- **Separate‑piece, NaN, and degenerate** models are rejected up front or caught at
  the output stage with a clear message and no leftover objects.
- Regenerating only ever clears MoldForge's own `MF_*` objects — your own objects
  are never deleted, even if they live in a "MoldForge" collection.

## Limitations

- Contoured 2‑part parting works best on convex‑ish, centered models; for trickier
  shapes use `Auto` orientation, interlocking teeth, or 3–4 pieces.
- Very thin walls relative to model size limit how large alignment keys can be
  (keys are auto‑clamped to the wall thickness).
- Sprue/vents are placed at the model's highest vertices; complex tops may want
  manual touch‑up.
- Radial multi‑part registration is a light seam pin plus the shared flange — band
  or clamp the wedges together when casting.
